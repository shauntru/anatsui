          <blockquote class="concept">The sculptures of El Anatsui emanate an uncanny and magnificent aura when first viewed. Beyond that initial impression there is a singular point at which the viewer's eye turns critical and catches the actual composite material that underlies the work's complexity. Like a manifestation of punk pointillism, there is an almost physical jolt the viewer experiences when they "zoom in" and realize Anatsui composes his dreamscapes almost entirely of bottle caps.</blockquote>
          <blockquote class="concept">I happened across Anatsui's work, fresh out of my library and information science program, in the summer of 2012 while browsing the galleries of the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh. On seeing Anatsui's work for the first time I was transfixed by a kind of sculpture completely unique and new to me, and felt an instantaneous affinity to his work. There are parallels that I read in Anatsui's sculpture to found art, personal geographies and psychic mapping, 8-bit and pixel art, upcycle and freeuse culture, network theory and data visualization. Above all there is something in reviving obsolescent and disused objects that always appeals to me. There is a recognition in Anatsui's work of the pervasiveness of memory and of past phenomena. This awareness is inherent to the way in which the materiality of Anatsui's art recovers value from the overflow and excesses of modern societies' drive for consumption. The bottle caps themselves act as a kind of synecdoche for disposable culture and unavoidable waste.</blockquote>
          <blockquote class="concept">I mention library science because right away I saw in Anatsui's sculptures a kind of artificial language constructed from raw data. It came as somewhat of a revelation later to learn that El Anatsui refers to his own work as data. The visual comparison of Anatsui's sculptures to a scrolling screen of hexadecimal code or a view of the underlying bitstream of a digital file may be second nature to someone who spends too much time in front of a computer monitor, but it is something more to know that the artist is intentionally signaling the concept of data (with his choice of materials and method of composition). Even the wood and paint works before the bottle cap sculptures have a tabular logic and are intentionally "reprogrammable". It is perhaps not surprising that an information professional would make inferences to spreadsheets, lookup tables, and data structures in the grid-like and atomistic networks that Anatsui constructs from individual nodes.</blockquote>
          <blockquote class="concept">I began to wonder how literal this comparison to data is meant to be, and the more I considered it the more I believed that it isn't intended to be metaphor. El Anatsui produces a body of data with each one of his works. Like a dataset, his works can be massaged, repurposed, recontextualized and processed through different modes of analytical interpretation. What we see when we look at Anatsui's work is already data visualization - an instance where information is transformed into art. The challenge for me became reducing the artwork into data, or rather separating out the information from the art. In a sense I set out to do the opposite of data visualization.</blockquote>
          <blockquote class="concept">By focusing on the individual bottle cap as datum, I have designed a simple open source framework using HTML, Javascript and Google Fusion Tables for cataloging (some of) the intrinsic information in the six works <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/artmuseum/el-anatsui-new-worlds" alt="El Anatsui's New Worlds Exhibit at Mount Holyoke">on display at the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum</a>. The project is meant to be a lightweight method for crowdsourcing, collecting and displaying metadata relating to the bottle caps, and currently serves as an example with only some of the data collected being made available here. I hope that the project will be improved upon and expanded over time by other researchers and developers interested in deriving statistical and informational elements from Anatsui's art. Likewise, I intend to make the Fusion Table on the backend accessible to researchers and individuals that can provide valuable metadata regarding the bottle caps in any of Anatsui's works.
